* M.S. in Mechanical Engineering, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 2027 (expected)
* B.S. in Aerospace Engineering, The University of Nottingham, Ningbo, China, 2025

Research Experience
======
* 06/2024--08/2024: Research Assistant to Dr Donglei Sun Faculty of Science and Engineering, UNNC, China 
* Prototype Development of a 3 Degree-of-Freedom Parallel  
  * Responsible for building a model of a 3-degree-of-freedom parallel actuator based on existing 
research, especially from the book Robot Modelling and Control 
  * Designed the trajectory of the actuator by drawing on knowledge of statistics and dynamics, gaining 
knowledge about robot modelling and control 
  * Applied theoretical knowledge in control of aerospace systems, and dynamics and flight mechanics 
to solve a practical problem

* Multidisciplinary Design Optimization of Propeller Performance and Noise Project 
  * Modelled the propeller design using SolidWorks
  * Carried out CFD analysis using Ansys, specifically CFX and CFD (Fluent) to simulate the different 
blade performances of the vehicle 
  * Gained knowledge of control principles

* 01/2023-05/2023: Research Assistant to Dr Salman Ijaz, The Control Lab, UNNC, China  
* Tail-Sitter Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Drone Project 
  * Applied control theory to enable the drone to operate successfully in the main phases of flight (take 
off, landing and cruise) 
  * Used principles of UAV electronic control system and Simulink software to stabilize the flight of the 
drone 

* 09/2022-12/2022: Research Assistant to Prof Haonan Li , Advanced Manufacturing Centre, UNNC, China
