title: "Heat sink design competition"
excerpt: " A bionic heat sink design optimized for additive manufacturing features conical pins with honeycomb holes and raised branches in a honeycomb pattern to enhance heat dissipation. Using ANSYS Fluent simulations, the design demonstrated improved thermal performance with a Figure of Merit (FOM) of 0.92264 W/(kg·K), making it suitable for binder jet additive manufacturing due to its complex geometry and small feature sizes.<br/><img src='images/heatsink.png'>"
